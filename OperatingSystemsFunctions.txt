establishing an internet connection:
operating systems normally have a section to provide a connection to internet. these internet connection can be wired like cable and DSL or wireless like Wi-Fi, satellite or 
mobile broadband. some connections will configure the setting automatically, but some others need to configure manually.

configuring devices:
device drivers are small programs that help the operating system communicating with hardwares. drivers need to be installed to work properly. when we turn on the system drivers communicate with the operating system and tell it how to communicate with the device.all devices like mouse, keyboard, webcam and etc have their own drivers.
